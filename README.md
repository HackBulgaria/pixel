# Pixel

A minimalistic pixelized Jekyll theme used by a few [HackBulgaria] classes. You
can see the theme in action for the [Core Ruby] class.

## Installation

1. Fork the repository. See the links on your right.
2. Bundle the repository with: `bundle install`.
3. Run the Jekyll server with: `bundle exec jekyll serve -w`

A server will be running on http://localhost:4000 by default.

## Credits

This theme is based on [left], a theme by [Zach Holman], so huge props to him.
